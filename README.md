# PyChart
Code Fellows 401 Python Final Project

PyChart is web-based application allowing the user a simple sandbox environment in which to upload or access data through API and render and save representations of that data.

## Git Workflow:
 
 * Git Master - One person in the group will control Pull Requests from development to master and control the deployment pipeline.

 * Issue Tracking - Feature Production and issues will be tracked using Waffle. [https://waffle.io/CCallahanIV/PyChart]

 * Deployment Branch: master 
   - All pull requests to master may only be approved by the Git Master.
 * Staging Branch: development
   - All work will be merged into the development branch via pull request.  
   - Developers may not merge their own PR, all PR's must be reviewed by another dev.
 * Feature Branches: by feature name
   - All features should have descriptive names.
 * Hotfix-Branches: <feature or development>-hotfix
   - Hotfix branches may be made off of any feature branch or the development branch to quickly fix small issues.
